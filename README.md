# CheQ Assignment

### CheQ Assignment UI with interactive animations, custom views and transitions. Created in a way that these UI is highly customizable and re-usable throughout the app. Just Like a Library.

Note: For meter animation i've created a custom view named: MeterView and I have created 2 seperate apks because meter animation was causing frame drops because so many animations are running in the main thread. For now i am not using MeterView in the final codebase but MeterView is already there in the codebase so if someone want to try implementing MeterView. They can try by applying app:meterText="6000" or any other number.

## Glimpse With Meter (Might have frame drops)
